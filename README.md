## Number Guessing Game

**Description:**  
In this game, the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and it continues until the player guesses the correct number.

**Features:**
- Random number generation.
- Feedback on guesses.
- Number of attempts tracking.

**Compilation and Execution:**
1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ number_guessing_game.cpp -o number_guessing_game
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   ./number_guessing_game
   ```

## Rock Paper Scissors

**Description:**  
A classic Rock Paper Scissors game where the player competes against the computer. The player chooses Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly selects one as well. The game determines the winner based on the traditional rules.

**Features:**
- User input for choice.
- Computer's random choice.
- Determination of the winner.

**Compilation and Execution:**
1. Compile the code:
   ```bash
   g++ rock_paper_scissors.cpp -o rock_paper_scissors
   ```
2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   ./rock_paper_scissors
   ```

## Tic Tac Toe

**Description:**  
A simple Tic Tac Toe game for two players. Players take turns marking cells in a 3x3 grid with X or O. The game detects win conditions and declares a winner or a draw.

**Features:**
- Two-player gameplay.
- Win and draw detection.
- Display of the game board.

**Compilation and Execution:**
1. Compile the code:

## Notes

- **Platform Compatibility:** The ANSI color codes used in Connect Four may not work on all terminals. Adjust the code as needed for different environments.
- **Dependencies:** No additional libraries are required beyond standard C++.
